#' Get Bee reserve size (relevant for a full node)
#'
# TODO light nodes do not have info about reserveSize, so this would have to be gained from Swarmscan via gathering info from several nodes and averaging
# actually, reserve size even on a light node can be gound at: http://localhost:1635/status/peers
# for various other nodes and then can be averaged ...
